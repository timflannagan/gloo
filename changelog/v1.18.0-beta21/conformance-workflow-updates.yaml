    description: >-
      Update the conformance workflow to use the "input" syntax instead
      of the "matrix" syntax. Additionally, fix the default logic that
      determines which suite invariant to run. Previously, this would
      default to the "experimental" suite when no profile was provided,
      but that's the incorrect behavior.
